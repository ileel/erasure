<br>
<br>
<p>This thesis is a collection of lectures, scores and short essays on the poetics and politics of erasure written over the course of a two year master study at the ArtScience Interfaculty in the Royal Academy of Art in the Hague, Netherlands. 

<p>The motivation for researching the topics of erasure and forgetting initially came from a number of sources: a deep seated aversion to memorizing and recording music as a performer and composer; a suspicion that the necessity for memorizing and recording information has darker roots and implications; and having these suspicions confirmed by texts such as Friedrich Kittler’s Gramophone, Film, Typewriter, Jacque Attali’s The Political Economy of Noise, and Niklas Zimmer’s “Elegy on Archiving a Deaf Spot”. I began with a media archeological approach, investigating the history of recording beginning with the written word, tracing it to the phonograph and continuing with the internet. It became apparent to me that there needed to be more research done in erasure and forgetting as generative methodologies. In Jack Halberstam’s The Queer Art of Failure, forgetting is “associated with radical action and a revolutionary relation to the new.” Forgetting means not only forgetting what you have been taught, but how you have been taught. Forgetting means to allow yourself to get lost. It is siding with Sartre’s ignorant schoolmaster who teaches that he has nothing to teach rather than revering the superior intelligence of the expert pied piper. It is an active refusal to internalize a hierarchical system of superior versus inferior knowledges. It is about modes of being and becoming.
<p>
In an interview, John Cage said “In contemporary civilization where everything is standardized and where everything is repeated, the whole point is to forget in the space between an object and its duplication. If we didn't have this power of forgetfulness, if art today didn't help us to forget, we would be submerged, drowned under those avalanches of rigorously identical objects.” While I agree with the sentiment of this statement, I would like to take it further and posit that forgetting can also involve being submerged and drowned under an avalanche, and identical objects are not always so identical. In the internet age where information is abundant, infinite memes circulate, and languages mutate daily; concepts of glitch and bit rot are embedded in our daily usage.  
<p>What happens can be visually demonstrated in the Playstation 2 game Katamari Damacy. The plot of the game begins after the King of All Cosmos has accidentally destroyed all the stars in the universe. In order to reconstruct the sky, he sends his son, the prince, to Earth to collect everything. He does this by rolling an adhesive ball (the katamari) around various locations on Earth to attract objects of increasing size (from pins to dinosaurs to mountains) until the ball is big enough to become a star. In this narrative we find an accelerationist narrative of our future. The king, in a drinking binge (over consumption) destroys the cosmos. The next generation collects all data and material regardless of form. The katamari constantly picks things up and occasionally knocks things off (additive and subtractive processes) as it bumps into larger objects, becoming an ever shifting honking, screaming, rumbling mess of giant octopi, skyscrapers, and islands until it is large enough to form a new star to add to a reconstructed universe. Beyond accelerationism, what is there?  During my research, I became interested in at least three categories erasure: Erasing forgetting, translating/mutating/amalgamating, Recontexualizating/Remythologizing
 <p/>
ERASURE/FORGETTING 	Forgetting is inherent in the process of remembering. Each time a memory (or a digital file for that matter) is recalled, bits of data are altered or lost. What happens in this process is a generative erasure. This is demonstrated in the sound world in pieces such as Ryan Maguire’s Ghost in the mp3 (2014), a series of compositions created by isolating the artifacts of mp3 compression; Christian Marcalay’s self explanatory Record without a cover (1985); William Basinski’s Disintegration Loops (2002-2003), where music on magnetic tape is repeatedly disintegrated in the process of being digitized; and Yasunao Tone’s Solo for Wounded CD (1997) In each of these pieces, new information is created as existing data is digitally and physically destroyed. Basinski’s Disintegration Loops is a particular example of generative erasure. After coming across a box of old tape loops he had recorded of an easy listening station in the 80s, Basinski decided to digitize the files. In the process of preserving the audio, he noticed some dust on the tape head and realized the tapes were literally disintegrating. The day after digitizing these tapes, the world trade center was attacked. Basinski filmed the smoke rising from the buildings and put the first of the Disintegration Loops to the video. “in the accidents and contingencies of resurrecting and destroying the old, Basinski had created a necessarily empty mirror of the new, a strangely proleptic soundtrack to the first great disappearance of the twenty-first century." 
The literary world has long recognized the potential of erasure to produce new meaning (Uljana Wolf and Christian Hawkey, Sonne From Ort), carve out new forms within an original (Tom Philip’s The Humument, Jonathan Saffran Foer’s Tree of Codes, Austin Kleon’s Newspaper Blackout Poems), or produce humor ( Dan Walsh’s Garfield Minus Garfield).

As Lowry writes bluntly “if it’s not Googleable it doesn’t exist.” on the other, the dissemination of information in the digital age can be seen as a disturbance of historical hierarchies , an “infinite reset to zero that transcends canonical cultural constructions and finds new means with which to construct individually circumscribable fictions” 215 The latter, while optimistic, opens up possibilities of constructing multitude parallel and intersecting systems that can

The performer alternates between scratching and playing the record, and delivering the written texts. Over time, the gradual destruction of the record reveals itself to be a composition that culminates in pure noise, simultaneously masking the speech of the performer. “Histories of Forgetting” was delivered as part of a guided tour of an exhibition at the Royal Academy of Art in the Hague. “On Erasure, Loss and Dust” is a performative lecture on the socio-cultural implications of sonic erasure, MP3 compression and dust. The lecture connects the history of sound archiving technology and (psycho)acoustic phenomena such as echo, masking and speech jamming with the dissolution and reconfiguration of identities. I discuss how these elements contribute to the breakdown of the individual in favor of the collective. Finally, Month of Digital Forgetting is a reflection of my month of abstaining from various recording technologies.

	Through these texts, I hope to navigate the various modes of generative erasure and unpack the politics and poetics of forgetting.

<font size="14">HISTORIES OF FAILURE AND FORGETTING </font>
<br>
<br>
<p>I’d like to guide you through a few histories of failure and forgetting.
<p>
I question permanence as a measure of success in systems and methods. I am interested in how this idea permeates modes of knowledge acquisition and transfer, and ultimately, how it produces, shapes, and destroys cultural identities. For these reasons I believe in contesting the idea of pre-established systems and methods remaining immutable because they are tried and true.
<p>
So today I offer you narratives of failure, forgetting and impermanence.
<p>
  <br>
  <br>
 I. WHITE NOISE WHITE OUT
<p>
I would like to begin with the origins of sound recording, which over time has developed an aesthetic that is increasingly clean and flawless. Rhythms are quantized, voices pitch corrected, mistakes overdubbed. This leaves no room for error. And yet of course the origins of sound recording are ridden with failures.
<p>
Edison invented the phonograph in 1877, intending to capture and preserve speech for years to come. This fascination with immortalizing the voice developed to the point that he attempted to invent a device that would allow us to communicate with the dead. He was not alone in his endeavours. In fact, he took on this project after he heard about Marconi and Tesla’s experiences with what is known as EVP, electronic voice phenomenon. The two inventors were working with radio waves at the time when they began to receive unexplainable voice transmissions. While Tesla believed he was speaking to beings from other planets, Marconi thought he was communicating with the spirit world.
<p>
But let’s get back to Edison for a moment. At one point he became unsatisfied with the recording quality of ensembles and orchestras, so believing that the sounds got confused as they travelled through the horn of his phonograph, he decided to build bigger and longer horns so that sounds could be “untangled”. In 1923 he built a 125ft brass horn and made several experimental recordings. Of course this was an utter failure and the project ended in 1924 because it was getting too expensive. In 1942 the horn was melted down for scrap metal for WWII.
<p>
  <br>
  <br>
II. ERASURE 
<br>In 1951, Bette Nesmith Graham, a Texan typist who was terrible at her job invented MistakeOut, a white liquid that she use to cover her typing mistakes. This solution became so popular that she founded her company Liquid Paper Corp which she eventually sold to Gillette, a company that has a monopoly on hair removal.
<p>
  <br>
  <br>
III. RADICAL FORGETTING 
<br>
Kodwo Eshun wrote on Afrofuturism,  “it has been necessary to
assemble countermemories that contest the colonial archive, thereby situating
the collective trauma of slavery as the founding moment of modernity.”
<p>
And so Malcolm Little, Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. and Herman Poole Blount forgot their names to become Malcolm X, Muhammed Ali and Sun Ra.
<p>
In the 1968 Warsaw Pact Invasion of Czechoslovakia, citizens of Prague painted their street signs white in a nonviolent gesture of protest. The story goes that only the signs pointing back to Moscow remained. Upon arrival, half a million troops were lost. 
<p>
  <br>
  <br>
IV. DIGITAL FORGETTING
<p>
Offering anonymity and interconnectivity, the internet brought with it a promise of the protean self, the idea that our identities can be more fluid and multi-faceted. However, what it has become is the ultimate storage and surveillance technology. One that cannot forgive because it cannot forget. Then again, it’s not the perfect memory we believe it to be.
<p>
We are all familiar with the 404 error code. Established around 1992, internet folklore has it that when scientists at CERN were developing the world wide web, they used a physical layout of their network so that different functions of the protocol would be designated to different offices within the CERN building.
<p>
The central database happened to be located in Room 404. Any request for a file was routed to room 404 where a few people would manually locate the requested files and transfer them to whoever made the request.
<p>
As the database began to grow, the number of file requests increased and as did the number of requests that could not be fulfilled, usually due to a typo in the file request. Eventually these faulty requests were responded to with the standard message: “Room 404: file not found”.  In the official release of HTTP (hyper text transfer Protocol), room 404 was preserved as a “place on the Web”,  a monument to the beginning of the world wide web.
<p>
The number 4 in Chinese means death, which is why some buildings in Chinese cities don’t have a 4th floor.

<br>LECTURE ON ERASURE, DUST AND NOISE  I was sitting in a room listening to a lecture. I don’t remember what was said because, to be honest, I couldn’t focus. I couldn’t focus because the room I was sitting in was so reverberant, it created an echo of about 2 seconds. So I could hear words coming from in front of me before it bounced off the walls, partially getting absorbed and losing energy before returning to my ears as a more washed up version of the original.  [repeat x times with delay and echo]
<p>
[CLEAR]  [delay + echo off] 
<p>
Earlier that day a friend presented a piece of hers that attempted to delete words coming from a speaker. She did this on two levels. The first occurred on a psychological level, involving speech jamming, which is when a speaker has their voice picked up by a microphone and has it played back to them with a delay of .3 -.5 seconds.  [Headphones + Phone speech jammer on]  This usually causes a glitch in the speaker’s brain, causing them to stutter, slur or even render them incapable of speaking.  [headphones off]  The second level of deletion happened at the ears via masking. The speaker had white noise played through their headphones which cancelled out all the frequencies of their own voice, so that they could not hear their voice traveling through the air. Only through bones.
<p>
The idea was to block feedback, to block a sense of self.
<p>
In addition to simulating deafness, masking removes a layer of human consciousness that was gained when we learned how to listen to ourselves externally. I’m referring to the phonograph, which essentially freed the voice from the throat.

<p>
The MP3 came into use in 1993. The lossy format used a compression algorithm based on a perceptual model of human hearing. This model was derived and refined by a listening test that was primarily designed by and for Western European men using music that they liked.  [Slide 6 up: distort vocoder]
 The test determined what sounds were perceptually important and which could be erased or altered. So the way that we listen to a lot of music now has been shaped by this test and musical data deemed unimportant by a small demographic is replaced with noise. Every time you retrieve an MP3 file, it degrades more. It gets noisier and noisier.

Every day humans shed 1 million skin cells which become dust. Dust that is not “about refuse or rubble so much as it is about a cyclical materiality.”
 For the unbecoming of me and the unbecoming of you is a becoming of us.

<font size="20">MONTH OF DIGITAL FORGETTING</font>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Recording history is about deciding what is worth preserving and what is not. Information deemed important is recorded, preserved and looped while information that is considered incorrect, unnecessary or unimportant is deliberately forgotten. For power lies in the ability to select repeatable molds.
 This is most evident in propaganda and censorship. Censorship is an active erasure of collective memory. But sometimes it also gives rise to a surplus of meaning. During an investigation of Nixon’s watergate scandal in 1973, the Federal scientific corp found a tape with 18.5 minutes of silence. What was erased supposedly contained criminalizing information that could have been used against Nixon. His loyal secretary Rosemary Woods claimed that she accidentally recorded over the tape as she was transcribing it and was interrupted by a phone call. With one foot on the transcribing pedal and a hand on the phone behind her, the pose that she assumed to demonstrate the moment of accidental erasure has been dubbed the Rosemary stretch.
<p>
Rather than erasing information, Nixon’s silence has produced a rich mythology based on cover ups and speculation, creating multiple versions of history. Until the erased information can be recovered, these 18.5 minutes of silence remain preserved in the US national archives.  The classical archive works to preserve a version of history that is desirable by present dominant political and aesthetic standards. It imposes measurements and definitions. It is a preservation of past regulations and functions as a document for the awareness of power.
<p>
The anarchive, on the other hand, challenges the classical archive. It is undisciplined, never ceasing to modify, to forget, to disturb any sense of certainty in historical, and by default, present narratives. They do not demand to know the truth of where things come from and where they may go.” They allow infinite shifting relationships between people, objects and narratives. 
Two seemingly contradicting approaches that go hand in hand in the anarchive are: Perpetual erasure and an endless proliferation of information. This is perfectly embodied by the internet, which offers multiple realities and fantasies intermingling and shifting so at any given time, reality is constructed of infinite superimposing hyperrealities. Simultaneously, each time we refresh our browsers, every time we retrieve a file, bits of data are altered or lost.
<p>
In the Manifesto for the dada of the cyborgembrio, Hans Scheirl writes that  “Loss and becoming are part of one process: mutilation is loss and becoming at the same time: lose an arm > become a fountain, get blown to pieces > get a new shape”  Loss, erasure and forgetting for me are generative methodologies. To reinvent histories, to mutate ideas and identities to the point that they are untraceable to their origins, to constantly refresh our relationships to the myths and semiotics that code our bodies, Through my research I have been advocating a forgetting of established methods and systems, a breaking away from the tyranny of an endless loop of absolute knowledge.
<p>
However, on a personal level, I wasn’t actively exercising this kind of forgetting. I wanted to integrate forgetting into daily practice. So at one point, and with the encouragement of my coach Arthur, I prepared myself for a month of abstaining from using memory storage technology. I wanted to do this to the fullest extent possible while being able to somewhat function in daily life.
<p>
The first step I took was listing all the ways I record consciously then subconsciously and automatically (software). I did not write, ask for reminders or keep any texts or emails I received.
<p>
The first week of forgetting was a mess. I missed a piano lesson I was supposed to teach, I also completely forgotten an appointment I was very pushy about getting despite the fact that I had recited a mnemonic for it: TL11: Tuesday Lex 11am. My usually over-organized life was starting to deteriorate and it scared me. I became nervous about scheduling new appointments and events.
<p>
I began inventing new visual mnemonics: oral acronyms, using fingers for binary info (on one hand: yes yes no yes no, major major minor major minor).
<p>
I didn’t tell people about my experiment because I felt embarrassed about it in some cases (ie. with students and their parents). 
In my second week, I was experiencing so much frustration and anxiety about the limitations I was facing so I met with a teacher of mine. She suggested that I come clean to everyone I was working with and who I met about my experiment rather than keep it to myself and make up less embarrassing excuses about why I couldn’t do certain things.
<p>
It felt like coming out.
<p>
The first person I had to come out to was a student’s mother. She asked to record myself playing a piece for her son so that they could work on it together. This was fine, except that it turned out she didn’t end up recording it. So she sent me a message asking me to record it again and send the video to her. I answered that I couldn’t and explained that I was taking a month to not record things as part of my artistic research. She didn’t respond.
  The way our lives are structured now within hyper-speed, super-productive, over- consuming capitalism makes it very difficult to delete information.  
<p>A STEP BY STEP GUIDE TO DEACTIVATING FACEBOOK TEMPORARILY 1.
<br>1. Find the deactivating button at the bottom of your account settings
<br>2. Go to a page that says “Are you sure you want to deactivate your account?     Your friends’ photos will be shown and above will be written “Taylor will miss you. Katarina will miss you. Denise will miss you” 3. Give a reason why you’re deactivating your account: Select “This is temporary”. A message will pop up suggesting that you log out instead.
<br>4.  Click close
<br>5. Click deactivate at the bottom of the page. A message will pop up saying “Are you sure you want to deactivate your account?”
<br>6. Click deactivate now. You will be linked to a page confirming that your account has been deactivated but that all you have to do to to reactivate it is sign back in.
<br>7. After one week you will start receiving emails from facebook updating you on what’s been going on since the last time you logged in. Ignore them.
<br>8. Your friends will start asking you why you haven’t responded to any of their facebook messages.
<br>9. You realize that your account hasn’t really been deleted and that it will actually take at least two weeks of inactivity for it to be fully inactive.  In this month of digital forgetting, I was mostly curious to see how my work and thought process would be affected.

<p>Another restriction I placed on myself was that I didn’t allow myself to save any files unless I needed to send an assignment to a teacher or a project to someone who commissioned a piece. In which case I could only save it once when I finished it. I also closed my browser and delete all files at the end of each day. This meant that I needed to work on things beginning to end as soon as I remembered to do them. This severely limited my multi-tasking ability.  I also usually take notes and make sketches in a notebook before and while I work on a piece, so this was particularly difficult. I couldn’t organize my ideas clearly and was forced to work linearly.

<p>During this period of forgetting, I had an urgent deadline for a piece that was to be included on a record. This piece was the only thing I worked on that could not be completed in a single day. I would open Ableton Live and begin writing the piece. I wouldn’t be able to finish it in one day so I would have to close the unsaved file at the end of the day. The next day I would do the same thing; lay it out, develop, delete, and the next day; lay it out, develop delete, and the next day: lay it out, develop, delete. This went on for a while until I realized that my deadline had passed a week ago. Eventually I decided to circumvent my own rules by sending the piece to other people to get feedback. So that when they responded to me I would be able to get the piece back as it was so I could develop it further.

<p>The supposed danger in having a bad memory is the possibility of constantly repeating yourself. It’s considered regression or failure to learn. But this measurement of success is based on capitalist notions of progress. We learn and progress by accumulating and developing a certain knowledge base. But what this model doesn't take into consideration is that there is a gap between knowing and understanding. 
I’m going to continue to try to learn to forget. I want to forget what I’ve learned to the point that I forget how I’ve learned. I want to tear down preconceived notions and models of thought, to create new neural pathways to different ways of thinking, doing and ultimately being.
