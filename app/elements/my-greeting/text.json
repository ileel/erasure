          "paragraph": "My motivation for researching the topic of erasure initially came from an interest in aesthetics of failure, a suspicion of the increased dependence on memory storage technology, and a frustration with the escalation of society’s archive fever. I began with an approach of media archeology, investigating the history of recording beginning with the written word, tracing it to the internet, and continuing with investigations in digital forgetting, archival power relations and identity politics. It became apparent that, although necessary, the need to record everything can have destructive effects on the ways that we learn, teach and understand the world and each other. We see this in hierarchies of knowledge, in the way that history is written and taught by dominant people, in who and what is deemed worthy of being recorded and preserved for future generations. From this point, I began looking towards erasure and forgetting, not necessarily to decelerate or counter the effects of recording, but to provide alternative and parallel modes of creating, learning and thinking.

I will then illustrate how a disproportionate investment in recording technology can have oppressive and violent effects, and what is at stake if we do not look towards alternative models of knowledge acquisition and dissemination. I will also explore the aesthetic and political possibilities that erasure can offer in the forms of erasing/forgetting, translating/mutating, and recontexualizing/(re)mythologizing, before outlining how these forms are present in digital cultural applications. This paper has no pretense of offering concrete answers. Rather, it is an exploration of various possible models of doing and thinking through erasure."

If we didn't have this power of forgetfulness, if art today didn't help us to forget, we would be submerged, drowned under those avalanches of rigorously identical objects.” While I agree with the sentiment of this statement, I would like to take it further and posit that forgetting can also involve being submerged and drowned under an avalanche, and that identical objects are not always so identical. In the internet age where information is abundant, infinite memes circulate, and languages mutate at an accelerating pace; concepts of refresh and bit rot are embedded in our daily lives.  "

          "paragraph": "What happens as a result can be visually demonstrated in the Playstation 2 game Katamari Damacy (released 2004). The plot of the game begins after the King of All Cosmos has accidentally destroyed all the stars in the universe. In order to reconstruct the sky, he sends his son, the prince, to Earth to collect everything. He does this by rolling an adhesive ball (the katamari) around various locations on Earth to attract objects of increasing size (from pins to dinosaurs to entire islands) until the ball is big enough to become a star. This game can easily be construed as an accelerationist narrative of our future. Accelerationism is “the insistence that the only radical political response to capitalism is not to protest, disrupt, or critique, nor to await its demise at the hands of its own contradictions, but to accelerate its uprooting, alienating, decoding, abstractive tendencies.” It is the idea that in order to effectively achieve any social change, characteristics of the current system of capitalism need to be accelerated and pushed beyond its limits."

The king, in a drinking binge destroys the cosmos (mindless consumption leading to economic, social and ecological collapse). In an effort to amend this catastrophic mistake, the next generation collects all data and material regardless of form (democratization of knowledge). The katamari constantly picks things up and occasionally knocks them off (additive and subtractive processes) as it bumps into larger objects, becoming an ever shifting and growing, honking, screaming, rumbling mass of giant octopi, skyscrapers, and islands (hybrid and mutating collectivity) until it is large enough to form a new star to add to a reconstructed universe (a new state, but not a complete tabula rasa). Throughout this introduction, I will elaborate upon this model, unpacking the aesthetics and politics of its various forms of erasure."

          "paragraph": "“To make forgetful animals into human beings, a blind force strikes that dismembers and inscribes their bodies in the real, until pain itself brings forth a memory” In this statement by Friedrich Kittler on the development of storage technology, we find a distinction between humans and animals made in the form of the written word and in memory. What sets apart human from animal, superior from inferior, is the use of storage technologies, the first being the written word. With the introduction of the typewriter and ultimately all recording technologies, humans became “an inscription surface.” Those that wield the power to write have the power to address. Since history is written by winners, colonists, and oppressors, the terms used by them to describe and ultimately shape the bodies and histories of the oppressed are the terms that prevail. They are the terms that we use to shape and understand the world and each other. As Judith Butler writes, “we are beings that require language to be”, so it is also through language that we come to be subjectified, dehumanized, or eliminated. We see this in slurs, in the way characteristics of certain demographics are systematically assigned negative connotations. In privileging the written word, a medium less volatile and less contested, not only did we allow our bodies, identities, and histories to be identified in dominant terms, we also ensnared ourselves in a looped process of knowledge legitimizing and delegitimizing. It is a dual process consisting of repeatedly propagating myths of a dominant culture, while stigmatizing, debasing or erasing ‘othered’ cultures."

As Jacquali Attali states, “power is no longer content to enact its legitimacy; it records and reproduces the societies it rules, stockpiling memory, retaining history or time, distributing speech and manipulating information.” This process of stockpiling memory is superimposed on models of learning, knowing, and being, operating in a loop of knowledge transfer that standardizes and institutionalizes superior knowledges while silencing and discarding those deemed inferior. We see this power exercised in educational and cultural institutions: biased curricula (privileging white male authors, history textbook controversies, genocide denials), academic journals that remain financially and linguistically inaccessible to many, standardized repertoire, the privatization of knowledge (the gravity of which Aaron Swartz’s suicide drew attention to), national/colonial archives, and museums. The solution cannot be a simple unwriting, total forgetting, or a return to purely oral traditions. However, it is clear in these examples that archival methods need to be reworked, or in the very least, need to make room for alternatives."

After the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, live streamed images and reports of the ensuing protests were trending on Twitter. Facebook, on the other hand, remained comparatively silent on the protests, instead extensively covering ice bucket challenge videos. Users realized that the difference was a result of Facebook’s news feed algorithm, which aims to get users to interact more with their newsfeed in order to generate advertising revenue. This is a significant problem considering the fact that users increasingly use both Twitter and Facebook as news sources. Through supposedly objective algorithms, corporations are able to extend and capitalize upon the process of privileging some information while censoring others.

We see this in user submitted content on platforms such as Wikipedia, which is constantly reviewed, deleted, edited and shaped not by a small elite group of experts, but by increasingly diverse communities of scholars; we see this in alternative unfiltered news sources such as Twitter and Reddit which have proven to be more efficient than traditional news outlets; we observe this in shadow libraries such as LibGen and aaaaarg, which continue to fight knowledge privatization, creating communities of people with multitude interests and gradually shifting elitist hierarchies of standardized curricula. With over 1 billion websites active to date, and millions of blog posts created each day, information accumulates, spreads and mutates at an accelerated pace."

No particular version has the monopoly on authenticity. So the jurisdictional claim loses control and consequently loses relevance” The many versions of the event, object or image, are “quantum superposition[s] of possibly infinite many, increasingly divergent, non-communicating parallel universes or quantum worlds,” all of which are equally real."

These forms of “creative destruction” are traps of capitalist thought, condemned to repeat themselves purely in imitation of capitalist machines. Rather, forgetting means not only forgetting what you have been taught, but how you have been taught. To forget means to allow yourself to get lost. It is an active refusal to internalize a hierarchical system of superior-versus-inferior knowledges. It is the forgetting and refusing of the names and identities that are forced upon us; to constantly refresh our relationships to the histories, myths, and semiotics that code our bodies."

Educational Complex (1995), for example, is a model of all the schools that Kelley attended reassembled in one space. The piece is not only a record of Kelley’s institutional past, but also a map of his forgetting. Kelley stated that these were areas he did not remember, due to possible trauma he may have experienced and associated with them. The resulting piece manifests as a sort of anti-ars memoriae, in which reconstructing architecture functions not as an aid to remember, but to map the degradation of memory. In each of these pieces, new forms are carved out of originals and new information is created as existing data is digitally, physically, or mentally eroded."

As everyone knows, the fun part of the game is hearing the resulting sentence after being processed through human filters full of errors, omissions and substitutions. Christine Schorkhuber and Alfred Grubbauer’s Stille Post (2008) applies further translation to this approach, feeding one text down three lines of non-professional translators. The original German text was about color and was subsequently translated from one language to another by various multilingual speakers before being translated back to German again. One resulting text was about love, another about legal papers, and one about religion. Similarly, Sophie Calle’s Take Care of Yourself (2007), revolving around a break up email she received from a lover, which she subsequently sent to women of varying professional backgrounds to interpret and respond to in a manner informed by their professions. From a forensic psychologist, who concluded that the writer was a “twisted manipulator” to a copy editor who marked syntactical and grammatical errors, an etiquette consultant who scrutinized the lover’s manners, to a markswoman who shot at the letter, Calle commissioned 107 interpretations and renderings of the offending letter.

For the most part, the singers are unsure of the lyrics beyond the chorus. The layers of slightly unsynchronized and awkward hesitations, silences, humming, pitch deviations, and improvised lyrics and syllables make audible the coinciding lapses in memory and surges of confidence. The result is a dynamic and texturally complex choral arrangement of the most covered song of all time; full of accidental canons, awkward solos, microtonal harmonies, moments of ghostly chants and scats, and messy tuttis.

Sophie always wears a maid’s costume inspired by victorian era dresses, but each appearance that Sophie makes calls for different versions of her dress which act as class signifiers. While conducting an imaginary orchestra, her dress fans out and suspends behind her in a grand red-carpet-like tail. Riding a rearing horse in a victorious pose, the horse’s reign is made of the same material as Sophie’s dress.

The performer alternates between playing/scratching the record and delivering quotes on recording, forgetting and neuroplasticity. Over time, the destruction of the record reveals itself to be a composition that culminates in pure noise. “Histories of Forgetting” was delivered as part of a guided tour of an exhibition at the Royal Academy of Art in the Hague. The text ties history with mythology, prompting a reading of the past and how it resonates in the present. “On Erasure, Loss and Dust” is a performative lecture that connects lossy compression and (psycho)acoustic phenomena such as echo, masking, and speech jamming with the dissolution and reconfiguration of identities. I discuss how these elements relate to the breakdown of borders in favor of noise, and of the individual in favor of the collective.
